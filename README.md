# Frontend Engineering Code Challenge - Wine Store

Welcome to the Frontend Engineering Manager code challenge! This repository contains a skeleton e-commerce application built with Next.js 16, React 19, and Tailwind CSS.

Your task is to take this partially implemented codebase and complete specific features to make it a functional prototype.

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. Clone this repo to your local environment.

2.  **Set your node version**

    ```bash
    nvm use 24
    ```

3.  **Install dependencies**

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

4.  **Run the development server**

    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

4.  Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## 📝 The Challenge

The goal is to demonstrate your ability to work with **Next.js App Router**, **React State/Context**, and **TypeScript**. We are looking for clean code, proper typing, and attention to user experience (loading states, error handling).

This challenge is broken down into separate steps or phases, each building upon the previous. We will provide you with the 6 different TODOs.


## 📦 Project Structure (Needs implementation)

```bash
├── app/
│   ├── api/products/route.ts  # Next.js API Route (GET returns products)
│   ├── layout.tsx             # Root Layout
│   └── page.tsx               # Main page
├── components/
│   └── ProductCard/           # Product Card component
├── context/
│   ├── CartContext.tsx        # Context for managing Cart State
│   └── CartContext.types.ts   # Cart Context Types
├── data/
│   └── mocks.ts               # Mock data source
├── styles/
│   └── globals.css            # Global styles
├── types/
│   └── index.ts               # Shared TypeScript definitions
└── README.md
```

## 🧪 Evaluation Criteria

We will be looking at:

1.  **Code Quality**: Is the code clean, readable, and idiomatic React?
2.  **Architecture**: How do you structure your data fetching and state logic?
3.  **Modern Patterns**: Are you using React Hooks and Next.js features effectively?
4.  **TypeScript**: Are types used correctly and consistently?
5.  **User Experience**: Are loading and error states handled gracefully?
6.  **Communication**: How are you talking through your ideas and solutions?

Good luck! 🍷
